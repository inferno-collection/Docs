## Welcome
Welcome to the Inferno Collection Documentation website.

On this site, you will find documentation for all our FiveM resources, such as how to install, configure, and customize our resources.

Our newer resources will have documentation directly here on this website, while our pre-2024 resources will redirect you their respective GitHub wiki pages.
