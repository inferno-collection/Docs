# WalkTest

WalkTesting allows players to RP testing individual [Components](components.md) of an Alarm System.  
When WalkTest is enabled and a component such as a Pull Station is activated, instead of triggering an Alarm, the [Components](components.md)'s ID is read out loud for all nearby players to here.  
For example: "Pull Station 10".

## Enabling/Disabling WalkTest

To enable WalkTest, access a Control Panel, enter the passcode if required, then select the WalkTest option.

## Using WalkTest

So long as WalkTest is enabled, simpling activating [Components](components.md) as normal will return the audio response expected.
