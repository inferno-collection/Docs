# Quick Start Guide

This page serves as a quick start guide to FAR.

## Which buildings have Alarm Systems?

Which buildings do and do not have Alarm Systems depends on the server.  
[Available for free](../install.md#optional---install-pre-created-locations) is a set of pre-created Alarm Locations in some base-game interiors.  
Server Owners and Developers are encouraged to use the [FAR Tool](../developers/tool.md) to expand the number of buildings in their servers.

## How do I activate an Alarm?

There are a number of ways to activate an Alarm System. Ths simplest to use a Pull Station (a small red box with a level or "t-bar"), however, smoke or fire can also be used where Detectors and Sprinklers are present.

Pull Stations can be activated by walking up to them and pressing the key prompted on the screen.

## How do I stop an Alarm?

There is also a number of ways to deactivate an Alarm System. To fully reset an Alarm System, the "alarm" (a.k.a. the thing that triggered the Alarm System) must be cleared. For example, if a Pull Station was pulled, the Pull Station will need to be reset. After that, the Control Panel can be used to reset the Alarm System.

Pull Stations can be reset, and Control Panels interacted with, by walking up to them and pressing the key prompted on the screen.
