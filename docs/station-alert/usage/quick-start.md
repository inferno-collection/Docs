# Quick Start Guide

This page serves as a quick start guide to SA.

## Which Fire Stations work with Station Alerts?

Which Fire Stations do and do not work with Station Alert depends on the server.  
Server Owners and Developers will need to use the [SA Tool](../developers/tool.md) to add Fire Stations to the Station Alert resource for their servers.

## How do I create an Alert?

This will again depend on your server. Some servers will have Alerts configured to automatically activate when a fire starts, others may be linked to CAD systems, and others again require players to manually generate Alerts in-game.

Server Owners and Developers should read the ["Start Here"](../developers/start-here.md) developer page for information on how to set up SA in their servers.

## How do I stop an Alert?

Once an Alert is activated an Alert cannot be canceled or stopped.  
Alerts can stack, meaning if one or more Alerts for the same station arrive at a similar time, the latter of the two Alerts will wait until the first Alert plays, and then automatically play the second.
