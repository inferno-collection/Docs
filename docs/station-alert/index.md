## Available Versions
There are two versions of Station Alert, and one [optional addon](usage/tts.md).

## Station Alert
The standalone version of Station Alert is just called "Station Alert" or "Station Alert (Standalone)".  
It supports all features, with some caveats:

- Text-to-Speech is supported, but requires the Voice Turnout Addon ([see here](usage/tts.md)).
- Sonoran CAD is supported, but requires at least the Plus version of Sonoran CAD ([see here](https://sonorancad.com/pricing)).

Station Alert can be purchased [here](https://store.inferno-collection.com/category/sa).

## Station Alert - Sonoran Edition
Sonoran Edition is a lite version of Station Alert that is provided to Sonoran CAD Pro customers for free.  
Some important notes for Sonoran Edition:

- Only works for the lifetime of the subscription.
  - Downgrading or canceling will result in Sonoran Edition ceasing to function.
- Text-to-Speech is included for free for the duration of the Sonoran Pro subscription.
  - Voice Turnout Addon *is not* required.
- Only Sonoran CAD integration works.
  - All other activation types (menu, command, exports, etc.) will not work.
