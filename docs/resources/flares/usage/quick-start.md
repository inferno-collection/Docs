# Quick Start Guide

This page serves as a quick start guide to IF.

## How do I use IFlares
To start, type the command `/iflares`, which will open a menu. Within this menu, you can select which IFlare type and flash pattern.

Once you have an IFlare type and flash pattern selected, use the preview prop to decide where to place your IFlare.

:::tip
Using first-person can make prop placement easier.
:::

Once you've picked a spot, click the "Place" option in the menu, which will spawn the IFlare.

To remove an IFlare, use the "Pick-up" button.

:::note
Depending on your [permissions](../config.md#permissions), you may not be able to pick up IFlares placed by other players.
