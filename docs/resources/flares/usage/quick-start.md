# Quick Start Guide

This page serves as a quick start guide to IF.

## How do I use IFlares
To start, type the command `/iflares`, which will toggle a placement UI; with this UI, you can select which IFlare type and flash pattern.

Once you have an IFlare type and flash pattern selected, use the preview prop to decide where to place your IFlare.

:::tip
Using first-person can make prop placement easier.
:::

Once you've picked a spot, follow the on-screen prompts to place an IFlare.  
To remove an IFlare, walk next to it while in the placement UI, then follow the prompts.

:::note
Depending on your [permissions](../config.md#permissions), you may not be able to pick up IFlares placed by other players.
