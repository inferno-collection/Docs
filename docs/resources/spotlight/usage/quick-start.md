# Quick Start Guide

This page serves as a quick start guide to Spotlight.

## How do I toggle the spotlight?

The default keybinds for Spotlight are `Left Control` and `Left Shift` - to toggle the spotlight, press both at the same time.  
To move the spotlight after turning it on, hold `Left Shift` and move your camera.

:::note
Unless [changed in the config](../config.md#secondary-keybind), the resource uses the Sprint key as the secondary keybind.  
By default, `Left Shift` is Sprint on most keyboards, however, it does change.  
For example, on some European keyboards, the `A` key is the sprint key.

## Which vehicles does the spotlight work with?

Any vehicle that has a spotlight that turns on with the vehicle's high beams should work automatically.
