# Installation

Follow the steps below to install HFS on your FiveM Server.

## Purchase the Resource
If you have not done so already, you will need to purchase the resource from [our store](https://store.inferno-collection.com/).

## Download from Cfx.re Keymaster
1. Go to [this url](https://portal.cfx.re/assets/granted-assets?search=Inferno+Collection).
2. Click 'Sign in'.
3. Sign in with the same Cfx.re account you used to purchase the resource.
4. Download the item created by `ChristopherM`, named `Hands-Free Siren - Inferno Collection`.

## Installing the resource
1. In your Downloads folder on your computer, extract the file, then locate the folder named `[inferno-collection]` and copy it.
2. Go to the server's "resources" folder, or wherever you normally place resources.
3. Paste the entire folder.
   :::note
   If you have previously downloaded our resources, and already have a folder named `[inferno-collection]`, you can still paste the new folder; the files will merge as required.
   :::
4. If you have not already, add `ensure [inferno-collection]` somewhere in your `server.cfg`.
5. Save and close your `server.cfg`.
