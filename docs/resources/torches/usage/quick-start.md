# Quick Start Guide

This page serves as a quick start guide to Torches.

## How do I toggle the Torch?
The torch is controlled via the [Torch Command](commands.md). [See here](commands.md) for more info.

## Which MP/Peds does the Torch work with?
Depending on [this config option](../config.md#allow-any-ped), Torches will work only with preconfigured Peds and MP Peds, or will work for all Peds.
