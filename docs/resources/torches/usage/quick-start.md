# Quick Start Guide

This page serves as a quick start guide to Torches.

## How do I toggle the Torch?
The torch is controlled via the [Torch Command](commands.md), the [`ToggleTorch` event](../developers/events.md#toggle-torch), or the [`toggleTorch` export](../developers/exports.md#toggle-torch).

## Which MP/Peds does the Torch work with?
Depending on [this config option](../config.md#allow-any-ped), Torches will work only with preconfigured Peds and MP Peds, or will work for all Peds.
