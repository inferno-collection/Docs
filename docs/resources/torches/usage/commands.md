# Commands

This page documents the commands for Torches.

Torches has a single command that supports multiple parameters.  
This means all commands start with the same prefix: `/torches`.

:::note
If [`allowAnyPed`](../config.md#allow-any-ped) is `false` and no preset exists, some of the below commands will fail and inform the player that no preset exists for their current ped.
