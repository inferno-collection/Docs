We will provide **$15 USD** in [Tebex Store](https://store.inferno-collection.com/) credit per complete translation, per resource.  
Rewards are first-come, first-served; meaning if you submit a translation after someone else, only the first person gets the reward.

If your language isn't on the list, we‚Äôre happy to include it!

### What is being translated?

Our newer FiveM resources contain a language entry in the config, which is a large table of entries.  
All you need to do is look at each line in the table and provide your best translation.

### I don't own XYZ Resource, can I still translate it?

Yes! The language entry is in the config of applicable resources, and those configs are available on our documentation website.  
No need to own or even download the resources!
