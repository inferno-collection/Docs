## 🤝 Coordinated Disclosure Policy

We ask researchers to follow a coordinated disclosure process:

1. Report issues **privately** via Discord.
2. **Do not** publicly share details before we give permission.
3. Allow **5–15 business days** (depending on severity) for investigation and resolution.
4. Follow this policy to remain eligible for recognition and rewards.

> 🚨 Publicly disclosing vulnerabilities without permission may result in disqualification from the program.

## 🛡 Safe Harbor

We are committed to working with ethical researchers. If you comply with this policy and act in good faith:

- You will **not be penalized** for reporting a vulnerability.
- We will **not pursue legal action** if:
	- Your testing does not disrupt services (e.g., no server crashes).
	- You do not access or alter data you don't own.
	- You report everything directly through our Discord.

> If you're unsure whether an action is permitted, ask first — we’re happy to clarify!
