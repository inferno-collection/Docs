## 💡 Referral Bonus: Get Rewarded!

Even if you're not a creator yourself, you can still help out — and earn rewards!

If you refer a creator to us, and we end up collaborating with them, you'll receive **Tebex store credit** as a thank-you. 🎁

:::note
To receive the credit, you must directly refer the creator to us - this means putting them in contact with us, or vice versa.  
For example, simply suggesting the name of a creator without providing us with an introduction does not count as a referral for store credit.

If you are unsure, please ask us ahead of time!

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

#### "I create roleplay videos on a server, can I apply?"

Yes — as long as you have permission to add the resource to the server you're filming on, you're welcome to apply.

For videos of this nature, the resource needs to be **clearly and prominently** featured.  
Using our Station Alert resource as an example: We'd expect a few minutes of focused content showcasing the system in action — not just a quick shot of driving out the open bay doors.

#### "I don't meet the guidelines, but I'm interested; can I still apply?"

By all means, feel free to apply - we endeavor to respond to all submissions, successful or not.  
Please note, however, that if your channel doesn't meet the typical thresholds, we may not offer free resources unless we see strong engagement or unique content.

#### "I want to refer someone, how much store credit will I get?"

Tebex Store Credit for successfully referring a content creator starts at $15 USD, and maxes out at $100 USD.  
The amount of credit provided is decided on a per-case basis, and depends on the creator referred.

#### "I represent a talent agency (or other 'organized' group of creators), can we contact you?"

At this time, we are not working with talent agencies, MCNs, or similar groups.  
We prefer to work directly with individual creators to ensure authentic relationships and communication.

#### "Instead of store credit, can I receive something else?"

For successful referrals, we are only offering Tebex Store Credit.  
This ensures the reward stays within our ecosystem and supports our ongoing development efforts.

#### "I only want to do a one-off video, not join your program - any flexibility?"

Of course! We understand not everyone wants to commit to an ongoing program.  
Just reach out to us on Discord, and we'll see what we can arrange.

#### "Will I still get access to the resource if I don't make the video?"

No. Access is granted in good faith and conditional on publishing the agreed-upon content.  
If you’re delayed, just let us know — communication goes a long way.  
We reserve the right to revoke access if a video isn't delivered in a reasonable timeframe without communication.

#### "Can I keep access to a resource after making a video?"

Absolutely! Once you've completed your part, you're free to use the resource as you please (including using it in a FiveM community).

#### "Can I use the same video across multiple platforms?"

100%! In fact, we encourage it. Feel free to share your video on YouTube, TikTok, Instagram Reels, etc. — just let us know where you post it.

#### "Are there any content restrictions or rules I should know about?"

Content must adhere to the following:
- Be an honest, good-faith representation of the resource(s)
- Not contain any hate speech, harassment, or other inappropriate behavior
- Not make any misleading or false claims

We know not every resource is for everyone, and you're welcome to share your honest opinions — we just ask that any criticism be respectful and constructive.

#### "I still have questions!"

Reach out on Discord, we can help you there.
